// javascript works with different types of variables
//string variable is a text variable, put in quotes
//number variable is a number, no quotes
//boolean variable is true or false

//let (type of variable) something (name of variable) = "Hello World" (value of variable);
//variables are only written in letters and numbers, camelCase

//console.log(something)

//constant are the opposite of variables, so the value cannot be changed
//constants should be written in all caps?

//var, another type of variable, older version of let
